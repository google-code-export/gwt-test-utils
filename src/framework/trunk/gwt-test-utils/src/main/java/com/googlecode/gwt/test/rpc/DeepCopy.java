 * Utility for making deep copies (vs. clone()'s shallow copies) of objects. Objects are first
 * serialized and then deserialized. Error checking is fairly minimal in this implementation. If an
 * object is encountered that cannot be serialized (or that references an object that cannot be
 * serialized) an error is printed to System.err and null is returned. Depending on your specific
 * application, it might make more sense to have copy(...) re-throw the exception.
