/**
 * <p>
 * Interface for a class patcher.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A patcher provides custom bodies (implementations) for the methods of a class. Patchers are used
 * to replace methods implementations which are not suitable for a JVM (typically, those containing
 * Javascript code) by valid Java ones.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It's based on javassist framework to make bytecode manipulation simple.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Although the framework provides some generic implementations of this interface (which should
 * permit to produce iso-functional, Java compliant code in the majority of cases), it is possible
 * for you to create your own patcher (specifically, if you're writing your own GWT component class)
 * if the default patching mechanisms doesn't suit your needs.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The custom patchers used to test an application are configured in the
 * META-INF\gwt-test-utils.properties file.
 * </p>
