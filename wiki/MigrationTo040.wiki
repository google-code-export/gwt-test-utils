#summary This page explains how to migrate to versions 0.40, 0.33.5, 0.28.12, 0.25.9 or 0.22.9

Version 0.40 (and 0.33.5, 0.28.12, 0.25.9, 0.22.9 branches) of _gwt-test-utils_ introduces the support for [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/wiki/OverlayTypes GWT overlay types].

As many current users won't care, it is a major improvement, which opens a lot of possibilities to support GWT DOM related features in a better way.

= Why now ? =

Until today, there were (very) hugly hacks in _gwt-test-utils_ to avoid {{{ClassCastException}}} when some GWT's code does some {{{JavaScriptObject}}} upcasting. And when some people asked how to test code which relies directly on overlay types feature, we had to tell them to use {{{GWTTestCase}}}.. (see [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-test-utils/issues/detail?id=97 here] for example).

We were aware of the fact that supporting overlays would include some changes in _gwt-test-utils_ public API.
More important, it would introduce some overhead at the loading of your custom classloader, since overlay types emulation in the JVM is not possible without an iteration through every class in the GWT frontend and and in your module(s), searching for {{{JavaScriptObject}}} subtypes and {{{SingleJsoImpl}}} annotated classes in order to make the necessary (and heavy) bytecode modifications.
*For us, it was not admissible to wait 4-5 secondes to launch our tests.*

But today, we realized avoiding overlay types support is not possible anymore : a lot of coming features, such as [https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/articles/elemental Elemental] (GWT 2.5) or [http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/gxt-3.0.0/javadoc/gxt/com/sencha/gxt/core/client/dom/XElement.html XElement] (GXT 3.0) directly relies on overlays and we can't use your existing hugly hacks to make them work.

Before (amazing) test performances, what is the most important for us is you to continue to rely on gwt-test-utils to write your UI tests and not to be stuck with an old version of GWT / GXT.
Don't be afraid, *gwt-test-utils still remains about 10 times faster than {{{GWTTestCase}}} !* It still doesn't need to run the entire GWT stack.

= Migration =

Since we need more informations at the very beginning of a test class instanciation, we had to make some breaking changes in the way _gwt-test-utils_ is setup. Following thoses steps, migration would take you *less than five minutes* :

  * Update your _gwt-test-utils_ dependency (it's a good way to start !)

  * The {{{GwtTest.getModuleName()}}} abstract method does not exist anymore. Instead, you have to your {{{GwtTest}}} sublclasses like that :

{{{
      @GwtModule("com.googlecode.gwt.test.SampleModule")
      public class SampleTest extends GwtTest { ... }
}}}

_Note : {{{GwtModule}}} is an inherited annotation, which means you can use it on an parent test class if you have one._

 * In your {{{META-INF/gwt-test-utils.properties}}} configuration file, the value 'module-file' value is not supported anymore. You have to change lines such as :

{{{ 
      com/googlecode/gwt/test/SampleModule.gwt.xml = module-file 
}}}

to :

{{{
      com.googlecode.gwt.test.SampleModule = gwt-module
 }}}

= Future =

By using {{{gwt-dev}}} internal features to load modules data (see [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/source/browse/trunk/dev/core/src/com/google/gwt/dev/cfg/ModuleDef.java ModuleDef] and [http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/source/browse/trunk/dev/core/src/com/google/gwt/dev/javac/CompilationState.java CompilationState]), we've opened the way to support some other features _gwt-test-utils_ was unable to handle, such as code Generators, on which a lot of GWT APIs relies.
Some of those are already supported ({{{UiBinder}}}, {{{ClientBundle}}}), others not ({{{Editors}}}). In future releases, It would be great if _gwt-test-utils_ could transparently create, compile and run the Java code from every Generators !
