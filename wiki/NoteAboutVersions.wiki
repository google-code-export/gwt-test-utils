#summary This page explains how to choose the gwt-test-utils version to use

= GWT compatibility =

An important thing to know about _gwt-test-utils_ is that it relies on _GWT_ internal APIs.

So, when a new GWT version is released, its compatibility with the current version of _gwt-test_utils_ cannot be ensured. In order to make them work together, we may have to apply some modifications on the framework internal APIs ; those changes could, in turn, break the framework's compatibility with older versions of _GWT_.

Here is a recap of the latest versions of the frameworks compatible with a given GWT version :

|| GWT version || Latest gwt-test-utils compatible version ||
|| *GWT 2.3.0* || gwt-test-utils-0.29 ||
|| *GWT 2.2.0* || gwt-test-utils-0.28.2 ||

= Public API modifications =

Since _gwt-test-utils-1.0_ has not been released yet, its public API might evolve if we realize there is a better and easier way to write GWT test code.
If such a modification is introduced in a release, it would be listed in the [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-test-utils/wiki/HowToMigrateToLastestVersion How to migrate to lastest version] wiki page.

Note that from version 0.28, the public API *should be compatible from one version to another*.
