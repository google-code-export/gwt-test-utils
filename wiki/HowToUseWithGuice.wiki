#summary This page explains how to test your GWT / Guice applications.

Since a GWT application usually deals with a backend server, you may be interested in using Guice to manage your RPC services.

_gwt-test-utils_ comes with some classes to allow you to test your entire GWT + Guice stack very easily.

= How to use =

{{{

public class DemoGuiceTest extends GwtGuiceTest {
  
  
  @Override
  public String getModuleName() {
    return "com.octo.gwt.test.demo.Application";
  }
  
  // ...
  
}

}}}

Instead of extending GwtTest, your test class must extends GwtGuiceTest which internally adds some extra behaviours. That's it !
