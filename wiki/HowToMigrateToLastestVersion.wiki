#summary This page explains how to migrate to gwt-test-utils-0.25

= Purpose =

For the 0.25 release of *gwt-test-utils*, the public API has changed to be more convenient. Unfortunatly for our users, it will involve some changes that are listed bellow.


= Details =

1) gwt-test-utils third-party dependencies have been updated.
=> So, if you're not using maven, you first will have to update [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-test-utils/wiki/HowToUse#Without_Maven gwt-test-utils dependencies].

2) Some classes of *gwt-test-utils-integration* module, which was used to provide with CSV-based synthax for complex integration scenario, have been moved to *gwt-test-utils* core module. Now, you will be able to bind your RPC service implementation to your client side code without *gwt-test-utils-integration* module.

Since it just deals with CSV synthax feature, it has been renamed to "{{{gwt-test-utils-csv}}}".

=> So, if you're using maven and have a dependency to the old *gwt-test-utils-integration* module, you would have to replace it by the new *gwt-test-utils-csv* artifactId.

3) Some classes has been renamed for gwt-test-utils. Here is the list.

==== In {{{gwt-test-utils}}} ====

|| {{{AbstractGwtTest}}} || => || {{{GwtTest}}} ||
|| {{{AbstractGwtEasyMockTest}}} || => || {{{GwtTestWithMocks}}} ||
|| {{{GwtTestReflectionUtils}}} || => ||  {{{GwtReflectionUtils}}} ||

==== In {{{gwt-test-utils-csv}}} (used to be {{{gwt-test-utils-integration}}}) ====

|| {{{AbstractGwtIntegrationShell}}} || => || {{{GwtCsvTest}}} ||


4) Some deprecated methods have now been removed :

 * Gwt.click(), Gwt.blur()... => you will have to use {{{Browser.click()}}}, {{{Browser.blur()}}}, etc...
