[http://code.google.com/p/google-gin/ google-gin] provides an elegant and easy way to do dependency injection in GWT client code, through its {{{com.google.gwt.inject.client.Ginjector}}} class.

To enable _gwt-test-utils_ to instanciate your custom Ginjectors, all you need to do is to register a {{{GInjectorCreateHandler}}} during your test configuration.

It could be done this way :

{{{
  @Before
  public void setupGIN() {
    addGwtCreateHandler(new GInjectorCreateHandler());
  }
}}}

*That's it !* {{{GInjectorCreateHandler}}} will be able to handle your {{{GinModules}}} configuration without anything else :-)
