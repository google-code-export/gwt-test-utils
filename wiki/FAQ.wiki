== I get a {{{java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError}}} when launching my tests. What can I do ?==

This exception will be thrown whenever you use a widget fonctionnality which call a native JSNI method the framework does not patch yet for the standard JVM.

If the widget is custom (e.g. not in GWT standard API), you will have to [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-test-utils/wiki/HowToWriteCustomPatchers write your own Patcher class] to simulate your component behaviour in any standard JVM.

Otherwise, make sure you are using the lastest version of *gwt-test-utils*. If you are already up-to-date, please report an issue !
