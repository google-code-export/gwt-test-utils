== How to simule browser event on widget ? ==

{{{AbstractGWTTest}}} comes with some helpfull methods to simule a large panel of browser event, such as "onClick", "onDblClick", "onBlur", mouseMouve" etc.

In case the method you need is not available, just try with :

{{{yourWidget.onBrowserEvent(new OverrideEvent(Event.ONXXXX))}}}, where XXX is the GWT event you want to submit to your widget.
