An important thing to know about _gwt-test-utils_ is that it relies on _GWT_ internal APIs.

So, when a new _GWT_ version is released, its compatibility with the current version of _gwt-test-utils_ cannot be ensured. 
In order to make them work together, we may have to apply some modifications on the framework internal APIs ; those changes could, in turn, break the framework's compatibility with older versions of _GWT_.

We maintain a branch for each version since GWT 2.0.1.

Here is a recap of the latest versions of the frameworks compatible with a given _GWT_ version :

|| GWT version || Latest gwt-test-utils compatible version ||
|| *GWT 2.4.0* || gwt-test-utils-0.36 ||
|| *GWT 2.3.0* || gwt-test-utils-0.33.2 ||
|| *GWT 2.2.0* || gwt-test-utils-0.28.9 ||
|| *GWT 2.1.1* || gwt-test-utils-0.25.6 ||
|| *GWT 2.1.0* || gwt-test-utils-0.25.6 ||
|| *GWT 2.0.4* || gwt-test-utils-0.22.6 ||
