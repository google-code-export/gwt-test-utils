#summary This page explain what part of UiBinder is supported or not by gwt-test-utils

= Introduction =

Since version 0.28, *gwt-test-utils* is working with UiBinder. However, there still is some parts of its API which do not behave in the test framework like it should be in real GWT application (DevMode or ProductionMode).


= Details =

Here is the list of feature which are fully working :
 * UiBinder templates with HTML element
 * UiBinder templates with GWT widgets
 * All GWT EventHandler (you can found information about how to simulate Browser events [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-test-utils/wiki/Events here])
 * GWT styles
 * External resources
 * @UiFactory
 * Shared object instances (provided @UiField)


If something goes wrong with one of those features, please [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-test-utils/issues/list report an issue] or feel free to ask on the framework [http://groups.google.com/group/gwt-test-utils-users user mailing list].

*We are aware of only one feature which is not working has expected when launching our GWT application : [http://code.google.com/intl/fr-FR/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideUiBinderI18n.html UiBinder i18n support].*
