= Introduction =

Since a GWT application usually deals with a backend server, you may be interested in using spring to manage your RPC services. A lot of simple framework, like [http://code.google.com/p/gwtrpc-spring/ gwtrpc-spring] will handle the glue code beetwen spring and GWT for you.

But you also might want to test your entire stack. That's why *gwt-test-utils* comes with some classes to do it very easily.

= Maven dependencies =

*gwt-test-utils* provides 2 different modules respectively designed to work with [http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/index.html Spring 2] and [http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html Spring3].
